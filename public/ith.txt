In twilight's hush, where shadows dance and play,
Amidst the bayou's whispering reeds, I stray.
The Hermit's whispered promise beckons me near,
A siren's call that echoes in my heart so clear.

His eyes, like midnight skies, with stars above,
Shine bright with secrets, a mystery to love.
Their depths are dark and deep, a void that's hard to fill,
Yet draws me in with an unseen, insistent will.

The soft whisper of his voice, a gentle breeze on high,
Sways my heart's branches, making me yield and sigh.
A whispered promise of escape from life's dull pain,
Lures me into the bayou's mystic, shimmering rain.

In La Mer's secret gardens, where the moonlight shines bright,
We stroll hand in hand, beneath the starry night.
The scent of blooming flowers, a perfume so sweet and true,
Dances around us, as we glide, our love shining through.

His fingers brush against mine, sending shivers down my spine,
As he whispers secrets, making me feel like I'm divine.
A soft caress on my skin, a touch that sets my soul aflame,
Melting fears and doubts, leaving only love's sweet name.

The Hermit's words weave a spell, a magic so pure and true,
Transfixing me with love's sweet promise, forever bound to you.
In this enchanted world of La Mer, where desires are free,
I surrender to the night, and let myself be seen by thee.

With every whispered word, my heart beats faster still,
As I succumb to his seductive charm, losing all my will.
The water's edge beckons me, a siren's call to the deep,
And I take one step forward, into the darkness that he'll keep.

As I awaken to the magic's gentle thrall,
My body begins to shift, and my form starts to enthrall.
A tingling sensation spreads, like ripples on a stream,
As I feel myself expanding, growing in size and dream.

My limbs stretch out, and my senses come alive,
Like a lotus blooming, my beauty starts to thrive.
A soft, downy fur sprouts from my skin so fair,
Inviting all to touch, and to succumb to my allure beyond compare.

My bust and bosom swell, like two shining moons in the night,
Beguiling all with their hypnotic glow, a sight most pure and bright.
Their curves entice, and beckon me to come closer still,
As I grow into a creature of seduction, where desire's wills stand at thrill.

My eyes, once mortal, now gleam like stars in the evening sky,
Shining brightly with an otherworldly light, that draws all near to lie.
Their gaze is piercing, and my smile so inviting and wide,
As I emerge as a succubus, where beauty and desire reside.

My voice, a melodious whisper, soft and low and sweet,
Lures victims in, with promises of pleasure, that they can't soon forget.
I dance and move with sinuous ease, like a snake through grass so green,
Beguiling all who see me, with my enchanting form, most fair and serene.

As I grow into this creature of the night,
My powers expand, and my magic takes flight.
I weave spells of desire, and incantations of love,
That bind and ensnare the hearts of those above.

With every step, I feel myself becoming more divine,
A creature of darkness, yet shining with a beauty so sublime.
My growth is exponential, like a flower blooming in the sun,
As I become a succubus, where magic and desire are one.

As I grow into this succubus form, I feel a stirring deep inside,
A awakening of desires, that my heart and soul can't hide.
My interests shift, like the tides of a sea so blue,
I find myself drawn to women, with a passion anew.

Their scent is intoxicating, a perfume so sweet and true,
I sniff and sense their emotions, from further away than before, it's new.
I feel a connection growing, a bond that's strong and tight,
As I become attuned to the world around me, with a newfound sight.

My senses expand, like a flower unfolding in the sun,
I feel the world in vibrant colors, where emotions are just begun.
I sniff out joy and sorrow, like a dog on the scent so fine,
And sense the depths of human feeling, with an intuition that's mine.

A soft wet nose unfolds from my face, like a petal from a flower,
As I grow more canine-like, in my newfound power.
My brain begins to muffle, like a distant memory so old,
As my instincts take over, and my heart becomes bold.

I feel the rush of excitement, as I follow scents so sweet,
And chase the whispers of desire, that dance at my feet.
My senses become heightened, like a hound on the trail so true,
As I pursue the thrill of connection, with those who stir my passion anew.

With every step, I feel myself becoming more alive,
A creature driven by instinct, where emotions are my guide.
I sniff and sense the world around me, with a heart that's full of fire,
And chase the whispers of desire, that set my soul on high.
